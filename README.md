# Flight_fare-Prediction
It is a Flight_fare Prediction Web Application Using Machine learning,Python and flask 
Using  Machine leaning i have created a Flight-fare prediction model in juypter
I have choosen one year  of data of flight booking from kaggle 
I have used Six different Algorithms like LinearRegreesion,RandomforestRegressor,DecisionTree,Gradient Boosting,K Neighbour and xgboost and the prediction is done on Xgboost beacuse
xgboost has high accuarcy.
The model also has PCA (Principle Component Analysis)
I have used Flask for web application a
The model is deployed on heroku
